## iOS ❤️ Machine Learning

Sometimes ML is perceived as a super complicated topic, requiring deep knowledge of various algorithms and math. While it is true on the academic level (in order to understand scientific papers you might need such knowledge), it doesn't always have to be complicated on the practical level. Our goal is to create intelligent applications, not improve performance of the state of the art algorithms (leave this task for scientists working at Universities across the world or smart geniouses at Apple, Google, etc. And in fact such a goal sometimes can be achieved quite easily.

The purpose of this article is to introduce reader to different ways of incorparating Machine Learning models into iOS apps. Let's start by understanding the high level architecture of how Machine Learning in iOS works in general.

### (Easy) Use Native iOS frameworks powered with ML

### (Medium) Download already trained models and use with CreateML

### (Hard) Train models yourself
