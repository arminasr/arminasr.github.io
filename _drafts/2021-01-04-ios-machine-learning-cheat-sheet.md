## iOS ❤️ Machine Learning

Sometimes ML is perceived as a super complicated topic, requiring deep knowledge of various algorithms and math. While it is true on the academic level (in order to understand scientific papers you might need such knowledge), it doesn't always have to be complicated on the practical level. Our goal is to create intelligent applications, not improve performance of the state of the art algorithms (leave this task for scientists working at Universities across the world or smart geniouses at Apple, Google, etc.

This article is meant to introduce reader to the concept of incorparating Machine Learning models into iOS apps. Three different approaches of utilysing the power of ML models will be presented, but I feel that it is important to understand the high level architecture of how Machine Learning in iOS works in general.

## 3 ways to incorporate Machine Learning into iOS apps

### (Easy) Use Native iOS frameworks powered with ML

### (Medium) Download already trained models and use with CreateML

### (Hard) Train models yourself
